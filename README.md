# Recruitment task

Hi! In this task, we would like you to show us that you can perform basic operations on reStructuredText (RST) files.

If you have never worked with RST format before, you will easily find resources online. In the ``doc`` folder of this repository, you will also find some documentation files that are written using RST syntax. They should give you a good idea how to handle this format.

Note: RST files can be viewed and edited with any text editor, for example Notepad++.

Your task is to convert the small documentation section that you got from us in Word format (*Upgrade with nRF Connect for Mobile*) into RST, in such a way that it becomes an integral part of the documentation set that already exists in this repository.

## GitHub repository

This GitHub repository already contains some documentation files in the ``doc`` folder. You will find two types of files in there:

* RST files with ``.rst`` extension. They hold the content of this small documentation set. View them to see how RST syntax looks like. Your main task involves editing one of these files or adding a new RST file (whichever you consider more appropriate).
* All other files. They constitute the build framework that we have set up for you. They are used to build HTML from RST. Do not edit them in any way or things might stop working.

## Interacting with the repository files

GitHub allows you to view the files in this repo, but in order to interact with them in any way, you will need to get them onto your hard drive. The default way of interacting with the files is the following:

1. Use the Download button to get the files onto your PC.
2. Complete your task.
3. Zip the repository with your added/modified RST files and send it to us via email.

Note: An alternative way is to fork this repository, perform the task, and then send us a link to it (or open a pull request with your changed files). Attempt this method only if you have considerable experience with Git.

## Building the output

After downloading the repo to your PC, start by building HTML documentation output from the already existing RST files. You will find the build instructions in ``/doc/building_the_docs.rst``.

This will give you an idea of how different RST syntax is reflected in the resulting HTML.

When you are done with the task, it is also important that you check the result of your work by building HTML from the RST file that you have added or edited. Any build errors indicate that something is wrong in RST syntax. Make sure that the added section displays correctly in the HTML output.

## Task objective

Your task is successfully completed if we get from you a zipped repository where the section *Upgrade with nRF Connect for Mobile* is part of the RST source files and of the resulting HTML output.
