# Recruitment task

Hi! In this task, we would like you to show us that you can perform basic tasks related to reStructuredText (RST) and Git.
Even if you haven't got much experience with them, there are plenty of resources available online that can help you get started.

## Main task

Your task is to correctly edit the **RST file** that we have created for you in the ``doc`` folder by adding **the following content to it**. Pay attention to correct RST syntax and correct language.

Do not edit the other files in that folder, these are build files that will let you build the RST source into HTML output and check whether everything looks ok.

### Building the output

It's important that you check the result of your work by building HTML from the RST file that you have edited. You will find the build instructions in ``/doc/building_the_docs.rst``.

## Task workflow

There are three main steps you need to take to complete this task:

1. Get the files from this repository onto your PC so that you can interact with them.
2. Edit the RST file and build the output to check its correctness (main task).
3. Deliver your work to us.

You can achieve this in two alternative ways.

### Do it in Git

You will need [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org) to run the Git commands on your PC.

1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to create your copy of it.
2. [Clone your fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork) to get the files on your PC.
3. [Sync your fork with the original repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#step-3-configure-git-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-spoon-knife-repository) by adding it as an upstream repository. If you have just cloned your repo, proceed from step 6 in the link (''git remote -v'').
4. Edit the RST file and build the output on your PC (main task).
5. Use Git Bash to add, commit, and push your changes to your fork.
6. Open a Pull Request from your fork to the original repository.

### Do it offline

1. Use the Download button to get the files onto your PC.
2. Edit the RST file and build the output on your PC (main task).
3. Zip the repository and send it to us via email.
